# NewbieFit


## Description

This NewbieFit application is dedicated for people who are struggling to get to the gym and workout, not because they are lazy but because more times than none they feel intimatated and don't know what to do.
This application provides a variety of exercises for the selected workouts at each submission, so the user doesn't get bored of having to do the same thing over and over. 
By using this application, newbies to the fitness world will no longer feel reluctant to workout. Quite the opposite, they will be motivated to show up knowing exactly what they are doing.


## Usage

When the webpage is loaded, NewbieFit is structured into three sections:
#### 1. Select Your Workout
It is Where the user gets to select their desired workout(s) for the day. There are no restrictions for how many they should select. Once that is decided, they can click on the "bieFit" button. 
#### 2. Recommended Exercises
Once the "bieFit" button is clicked, a pop-up comes up letting the user know that each generated exercise is a link to a demo and a variety of exercises related to the checked body muscles gets generated.
Once the user has finished working out, they can click on the "Complete" button. 
#### 3. Achievements
Once the "Complete" button is clicked, a modal pops up with a congratulatory message and a celebratory confetti effect is displayed on the screen. Finally, the previously submitted workouts get to be stored under this section along with the date. That way the user can track what they did on which date. This data get to be displayed on the screen until the user chooses to remove it by clicking the "Clear History" button.
